I had finally got what I needed and was going to give it my best shot.

Very usefull is aurora forecast app for your cellphone, where you can see the current solar winds status, low to mid clouds and also forecast for the next days. If the predictions are good, you just need to find a place with a nice view and wait till magic happen. Or you can just skip all this things and be amazed when aurora shows up"
